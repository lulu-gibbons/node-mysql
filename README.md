# Storefront Project

## Utilizing Node.js & MySQL

#### This Amazon-like storefront app takes in a customer's product order and depletes the stock from the MySQL database when the order is placed. 

### This app is powered by two NPM packages:
**MySQL package:** A Node.js driver for MySQL that is written in JavaScript and is 100% MIT licensed.

**Inquirer package:** Inquirer.js was designed to ease the process of providing error feedback, asking questions, parsing input, validating answers, and managing hierarchical prompts.
